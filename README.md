# RÃ¤ntekalkyl - Open Source Interest Rate Calculator

## ðŸš§ Warning: Project in Raw Dog Mode ðŸš§

This project is currently in what we affectionately call "raw dog mode". It's a work in progress with many AI-generated features and crowd-sourced information. Expect rough edges, potential inaccuracies, and a wild ride!

## What is this?

RÃ¤ntekalkyl is an open-source application designed to help users calculate and compare different mortgage interest rate options in Sweden. It leverages crowd-sourced information to provide forecasts for future rates and collects data on users' current rates to give a comprehensive view of the market.

## Key Features

- Calculate and compare different rÃ¤ntebindning (fixed-rate) options
- Crowd-sourced interest rate forecasts
- Anonymous sharing of current mortgage rates
- Open-source codebase for transparency and community contributions


## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
cd packages/web && npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
