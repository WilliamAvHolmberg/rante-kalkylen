# RÃ¤ntekalkyl - Open Source Interest Rate Calculator

## ðŸš§ Warning: Project in Raw Dog Mode ðŸš§

This project is currently in what we affectionately call "raw dog mode". It's a work in progress with many AI-generated features and crowd-sourced information. Expect rough edges, potential inaccuracies, and a wild ride!

## What is this?

RÃ¤ntekalkyl is an open-source application designed to help users calculate and compare different mortgage interest rate options in Sweden. It leverages crowd-sourced information to provide forecasts for future rates and collects data on users' current rates to give a comprehensive view of the market.

## Key Features

- Calculate and compare different rÃ¤ntebindning (fixed-rate) options
- Crowd-sourced interest rate forecasts
- Anonymous sharing of current mortgage rates
- Open-source codebase for transparency and community contributions

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
cd packages/web && npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! However, please note that due to the current "raw dog" state of the project, the codebase might be messy and hard to navigate. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

If you're brave enough to dive in:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
